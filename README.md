# AWS Terraform pipeline module
 
An efficient way to deploy Terraform ... with Terraform. 

üêì ü•ö ?

This module is designed to be deployed remotely, using the [GitHub source type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#github). 

## Prerequisites
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- An existing AWS CodeCommit repository
- Your code must include a [remote state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/remote) that this [codebuild role](./modules/pipeline/codebuild.tf?plain=1#177) can access. An S3 backend within the same AWS account is ideal for this. 

## Limitations
- This pattern (currently) only works with CodeCommit

## Architecture

![image info](./img/architecture.png)

1. User commits to existing repository. 
2. The commit invokes an Amazon EventBridge rule, which runs the AWS CodePipeline pipeline.
3. The pipeline validates the code, then runs a `terraform plan`, before waiting for manual approval. Once this is issued, the resources are built with a `terraform apply`. 
4. Pipeline artifacts are sent to an Amazon S3 bucket. Pipeline activity is logged in Amazon CloudWatch logs. 

#### Pipeline Validation

| Check | Description |
|---|---|
| validate | runs `terraform validate` to make sure that the code is syntactically valid. |
| lint | runs [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) which will find errors, depreciated syntax, and check naming conventions. |
| fmt | runs `terraform fmt --recursive --check` to ensure code is consistently formatted. |
| SAST | runs [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) for security best practices. |

## Deployment

This module should be deployed to a separate repository. Segregation enables the pipeline to run commands against "your code" without affecting the pipeline infrastructure. 

This deployment guide will use a `deploy` directory within your existing CodeCommit repo ("your repo"):

```
your repo
‚îÇ   README.md
‚îÇ   main.tf
‚îÇ   variables.tf    
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdeploy
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmain.tf <--module deployed here    
```

### Module Inputs

```hcl
module "pipeline" {
  source          = "github.com/aws-samples/aws-terraform-pipeline"
  pipeline_name   = "pipeline-name"
  codecommit_repo = "codecommit-repo-name"
}
```

`pipeline_name` is the name of your pipeline. 

`codecommit_repo` is the name of the repo with your code in it. 

All other inputs are optional. 

### Optional Inputs

```hcl
module "pipeline" {
  ...
  branch = "main"

  environment_variables = {
    TF_VERSION     = "1.1.7"
    TFLINT_VERSION = "0.33.0"
  }

  checkov_skip = [
    "CKV_AWS_144", #Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled
  ]

}
```
`branch` is the CodeCommit branch. It defaults to "main" and may need to be altered if you are using pre-commit hooks that default to "master". 

`environment_variables` can be used to define terraform and [tf_lint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) versions. 

`checkov_skip` defines [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) skips for the pipeline. This is useful for organization-wide policies, removing the need to add individual resource skips. 

### Deploy the pipeline 
1. Deploy the module into a different repo or a `deploy` directory in your existing CodeCommit repository. If you use a deploy directory, treat it as a new repo with a new provider and state.
2. (Recommended) setup a remote backend for your pipeline. 
2. Run`terraform init`, then `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure to your chosen AWS account.   

### Run the pipeline
1. Ensure your CodeCommit repository has a remote state configured that [this codebuild policy](./modules/pipeline/codebuild.tf?plain=1#198) can access. An Amazon S3 backend within the same AWS account is ideal for this, but ensure you use a different key to your `deploy` directory. 
2. Commit changes to your CodeCommit repository. This will run the pipeline. 

### (Optional) Edit the pipeline
If you need to edit an existing pipeline, do so from the `deploy` directory.

### (Optional) Setup a cross-account pipeline
The pipeline can assume a cross-account role and deploy to another AWS account. Ensure there is a cross-account role that can be assumed by [this codebuild policy](./modules/pipeline/codebuild.tf?plain=1#198), then edit the terraform provider in your repository to include the `assume role` argument.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Failed lint or validate | Read the report or logs to discover why the code has failed, then make a new commit. |
| Failed fmt | This means your code is not formatted. Run `terraform fmt --recursive` on your code, then make a new commit. |
| Failed SAST | Read the Checkov logs (Details > Reports) and either make the correction in code or add a skip to the module inputs. |
| Failed plan or apply stage | Read the report or logs to discover error in terraform code, then make a new commit. |
| `Error: error creating CodeBuild Report Group: InvalidInputException: Invalid encryption key: region does not match current region` during `terraform apply` | Ensure you have defined the correct `region` in `main.tf`.  
| `Terraform initialized in an empty directory!` | Make sure you are in the `deploy` directory when running `terraform init`. |
| Pipeline fails on apply with `the action failed because no branch named main was found ...` | Either nothing has been committed to the repo or the branch is incorrect (Eg using `Master` not `Main`). Either commit to the Main branch or change the module input to fix this. |

## Best Practices

The CodeBuild execution role is highly privileged as this pattern is designed for a wide audience to deploy any resource to an AWS account. You may want to reduce the scope of the role and define specific services or actions, depending on your requirements. If you are operating at scale with multiple pipelines, you should consider a [Service Control Policy (SCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) to protect the role from being edited or assumed by other principals. You could also use a SCP to prohibit actions like `IAM:CreateUser` or `account:*`. 

Permissions to your CodeCommit repository, CodeBuild projects, and CodePipeline pipeline should be tightly controlled. Here are some ideas:
- [Specify approval permission for specific pipelines and approval actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals-iam-permissions.html#approvals-iam-permissions-limited).
- [Using identity-based policies for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html). 
- [Limit pushes and merges to branches in AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-conditional-branch.html)

Checkov skips can be used where Checkov policies conflict with your organization's practices or design decisions. The `checkov_skip` module input allows you to set skips for all resources in your repository. For example, if your organization operates in a single region you may want to add `CKV_AWS_144` (Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled). For individual resource skips, you can still use [inline code comments](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html).
